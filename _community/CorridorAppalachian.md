Appalachian Corridor is a non-profit conservation organization founded in 2002 with a mission to protect natural areas in the Appalachian region of Southern Québec.
Through the implementation of a transborder conservation strategy, Appalachian Corridor works with local communities to maintain and restore a way of life that respects the ecology of the region from a perspective of sustainable development.

Through research with Dr. Jochen Jaeger at Concordia University, Montréal, QC, and the Minitry of Transport of Quebec, we collaborated with Corridor Appalachien to monitored multi-use underpasses for mammal use below
a high traffic highway that bi-sects the Appalachian ecoregion.
