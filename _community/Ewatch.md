The DFO Environmental Watch (EWatch) Program provides scientific advice on the impact of different environmental factors on the migration success of Pacific salmon in fresh water. 

This advice is based on our understanding of migration biology of Pacific salmon and the interaction with environmental conditions.

My research is a part of their program monitoring the physiological condition of Fraser River sockeye salmon to  understand ecological changes than impact population survival and better inform management.
