The Salmon Watersheds Lab’s mission is to understand the dynamics of aquatic ecosystems and inform their conservation and management, with a primary focus on salmon systems. 
I am proud to be a part of the dynamic and supportive team of the Salmon Watersheds Lab at Simon Fraser University, BC, led by Dr. Jonathan Moore. 
My research is a part of a broader group focusing on the importance of estuary habitat for juvenile salmon.
