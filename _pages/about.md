Following streams: From peatbogs to estuaries
=====
I am a Master's student at Simon Fraser University researching the eco-physiology of wild juvenile sockeye salmon during their downstream migration from lake to river to estuary to ocean. My interests lie along the intersection of land and sea, where coastal regions form immensely productive ecosystems for a spectrum of life. Although the diversity of coastal systems should lend to resilience, they are among the most threatened. Their threats are modern and anthropogenic, due to climate change and development for agriculture, industry or urbanization; Likewise, these threats are impossible to be removed. The solution to these global problems must come from local adaptive management of systems, and by including the humans who live and interact with these ecosystems, historically and presently, into our models of the ecological world. I am interested in adaptive measures to understand our rapidly changing ecosystems, and find adaptive solutions to confer social-ecological resilience to our coastal systems.
